This app was created by Isabel Glasbrenner for a coding exercise for my Fetch Internship application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Get started

To start my angular app, clone this repository and run "npm install" then "ng serve".

The app will be running on http://localhost:4200/
